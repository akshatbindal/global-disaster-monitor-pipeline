## 🚀 Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Data Ingestion (Cloud Functions)**
- ✅ Fetches real-time earthquake data from USGS API
- ✅ Fetches natural events from NASA EONET API
- ✅ Publishes events to Pub/Sub topic
- ✅ Scheduled to run every 5 minutes

### 2. **Data Processing (Apache Beam Dataflow)**
- ✅ Real-time streaming pipeline
- ✅ Geocoding using Google Geocoding API
- ✅ Demographics data enrichment
- ✅ ML impact score calculation
- ✅ Writes enriched data to BigQuery

### 3. **Machine Learning (Vertex AI)**
- ✅ Random Forest regression model
- ✅ Impact score prediction based on:
  - Event magnitude
  - Population density
  - Event severity
  - Event type
- ✅ Automatic model deployment to Vertex AI endpoint

### 4. **Data Storage (BigQuery)**
- ✅ Disaster events table with comprehensive schema
- ✅ Demographics table for enrichment data
- ✅ Optimized for real-time analytics

### 5. **Web Application (Streamlit + Cloud Run)**
- ✅ Interactive real-time dashboard
- ✅ Geographic map visualization
- ✅ Event timeline and statistics
- ✅ Filtering and search capabilities
- ✅ Responsive design

### 6. **Infrastructure (Terraform)**

- ✅ BigQuery datasets and tables
- ✅ Service accounts with proper permissions
- ✅ Cloud Storage buckets for Dataflow

## 🔧 Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. Google Cloud Project with billing enabled
2. Google Cloud CLI installed and configured
3. Required APIs enabled (automatically handled by Terraform)

### Quick Deployment
1. **Configure Environment:**
   ```bash
   cd global-disaster-monitor-pipeline
   cp env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your project details
   ```

2. **Deploy Everything:**
   ```bash
   # On Linux/Mac:
   chmod +x deploy-all.sh
   ./deploy-all.sh
   
   # On Windows (Git Bash):
   ./deploy-all.sh
   ```

3. **Load Sample Data:**
   ```bash
   cd deployment
   ./load-sample-data.sh
   ```

## 📊 System Architecture

```
USGS API → Cloud Function → Pub/Sub → Dataflow → BigQuery → Vertex AI
NASA API ↗                                    ↓
                                    Streamlit Web App
```
